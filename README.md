## About this project
This is an project I built to apply for the role of "**Frontend Developer Intern**" for the company [Tech Community Nepal](https://np.linkedin.com/company/techcnp).

The task was to recreate [this](https://ibb.co/Wcg5r4Y) image UI exactly down to a pixel into a web page without using any frameworks.

 You can see it running live [here](https://tech-community-task.netlify.app/).
